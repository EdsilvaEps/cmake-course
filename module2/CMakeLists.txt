# libraries and executables are called "Targets" in cmake
# common target properties:
# INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
# VERSION
# SOURCES

# target_link_libraries(calculator INTERFACE my_math my_print) => means that an INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property has been set to be used by 
# all the targets that depend upon calculator
# PRIVATE keyword means that properties should not be propagated

# * more than one executable can be generated by CMakesList
# * two targets cannot be of the same name
